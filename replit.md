## Recent Changes

- **Reset Game Feature Removal** (July 17, 2025): Removed "Reset Game" button from online multiplayer games per user request, keeping it only available in AI and pass-and-play modes to prevent disruption of online gameplay between players.
- **Achievement Badge UI Fix** (July 17, 2025): Fixed UI layout issue where achievement badges were overlapping Profile and Chat buttons in Online Players modal. Reorganized layout to separate achievement badges into their own row below user information, ensuring buttons remain fully accessible while maintaining clean visual hierarchy.
- **Matchmaking Synchronization Fix** (July 17, 2025): Fixed critical matchmaking bug where one player would start a room while the other remained in matchmaking queue. Root cause was duplicate WebSocket message handling and multiple room join attempts. Fixed by adding duplicate detection for match_found/matchmaking_response messages, preventing duplicate room joins through state tracking, and clearing room state on WebSocket reconnect to ensure clean matchmaking flow.
- **Theme API & Emoji Broadcasting Fixes** (July 17, 2025): Fixed special theme fetching errors by adding robust error handling for theme API calls, ensuring themes load properly even when database queries fail. Enhanced emoji reaction WebSocket broadcasting with better logging and validation, fixing issue where second emoji reactions weren't visible to other players in online games.
- **Matchmaking Auto-Start Fix** (July 16, 2025): Fixed matchmaking synchronization issue where matched players were placed in rooms but games weren't automatically started. Added auto-game creation logic that triggers 2 seconds after successful matchmaking, ensuring both players get a seamless experience from matchmaking queue to active gameplay. Eliminated duplicate WebSocket message handlers that were causing client-side warnings.
- **Achievement Badge UI Improvements** (July 16, 2025): Removed yellow circle background from achievement badges in game board for cleaner appearance, changed to simple text styling with proper theme support. Game board now shows only the latest achievement badge earned by each player instead of first victory badge. Enhanced WebSocket synchronization with better state management and forced re-renders to fix React sync issues between players. Removed date logic from achievement tooltips and displays throughout the application.
- **Complete Achievement System with Seasonal Themes** (July 16, 2025): Implemented comprehensive achievement system with 7 different badges (First Win, Win Streak Master, Master of Diagonals, Speed Demon, Veteran Player, Comeback King, True Champion) that unlock automatically when players reach specific milestones. Added seasonal themes (Halloween, Christmas, Summer) that unlock through achievements - Win Streak Master unlocks Halloween theme, Speed Demon unlocks Christmas theme, and Veteran Player unlocks Summer theme. Created database schema with achievements and user_themes tables, built beautiful achievement modal with locked/unlocked states, enhanced theme selector to show locked themes, and integrated achievement button into header sidebar. Fixed matchmaking synchronization issue where players received different message types causing inconsistent room joining behavior.
- **JSON to Neon Database Sync** (July 15, 2025): Added comprehensive user synchronization between JSON file storage and Neon database. System now automatically syncs all existing JSON users to the database on server startup, ensuring complete data consistency. Added manual sync endpoint for admin users to trigger sync on demand. All user operations (registration, login, profile updates) now maintain dual storage for compatibility
- **Email Service Migration to SMTP** (July 15, 2025): Removed SendGrid dependency and migrated to pure nodemailer SMTP configuration for email verification and password reset functionality. System now uses SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, and FROM_EMAIL environment variables for email service configuration. Added enhanced logging for email service initialization and sending status to help with debugging
- **Play Again Feature Fix** (July 15, 2025): Fixed critical bug where "Play Again" button wasn't working in online multiplayer mode - root cause was old finished game objects being reused instead of creating fresh game states. Fixed by clearing current game state before creating new game, ensuring fresh game objects with active status, empty board, and proper player assignments. Enhanced WebSocket game_started handling to force complete state reset and prevent stale game data
- **Interactive Emoji Reaction System** (July 15, 2025): Implemented player-controlled emoji reactions during gameplay with 12 different emojis (üòÇ, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üòÆ, üò†, üò¢, üòé, üî•, üëç, üëé, ü§î, üéâ, üéØ). Players can click the "React" button to open emoji panel and express emotions actively during games. Reactions appear next to player profiles with smooth animations and auto-fade after 3-4 seconds. Works in all game modes (AI, pass-and-play, online) with proper player identification. Added EmojiReactionPanel component for organized emoji selection with enhanced hover animations including scale, rotation, and continuous glow effects
- **Dynamic Player Ranking Visualization** (July 15, 2025): Implemented comprehensive ranking visualization system with three interactive view modes - List view with animated ranking changes and streak indicators, Chart view with win rate distribution and games played visualizations, and Stats view with overview metrics including total players, average win rate, most active player, and top streaks. Added real-time rank change tracking, animated transitions, and enhanced visual feedback for player performance
- **Critical Move Disappearing Bug Fix** (July 15, 2025): Fixed major bug where moves disappeared after 1 second in all game modes - root cause was GameBoard component being remounted due to timestamp-based key prop, causing React to lose all internal state. Fixed by removing timestamp from component key and optimizing board state persistence for both local and online games
