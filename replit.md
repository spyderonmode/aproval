# TicTac 3x5 Game

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for a strategic Tic-Tac-Toe game played on a unique 3x5 grid. The application features multiple game modes (AI, pass-and-play, and online multiplayer), real-time gameplay through WebSockets, and a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Game Abandonment Preference**: Only abandon games when users explicitly exit rooms (Leave Room/Main Menu buttons), NOT when browser is closed or connection lost.

## Recent Changes

- **Expert/Difficulty Button Overlapping Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed overlapping issue where AI difficulty selection dropdown (Easy/Medium/Hard) was appearing behind other UI elements. Root cause was z-index conflict - Select dropdown was using z-50 while language selector and other dropdowns used z-9999. Increased Select component z-index to 10000 and added specific CSS rules for select dropdowns to ensure they always appear above all other content. AI difficulty buttons now properly display above all interface elements.
- **Special #1 Player Visual Effects** (July 19, 2025): Added special visual treatment for the #1 player on leaderboard to make them feel special. Features include: enhanced golden animated border with stronger glow effects, animated sparkles in corners, special champion crown with enhanced rotation and scaling, "#1" champion badge with pulsing animation, larger and more prominent rank icon with golden sparkle effect, enhanced background gradients with warmer tones, and stronger pulse animation on the entire card. The top player now stands out significantly from other players with multiple layers of visual distinction.
- **French Language Support Removed** (July 19, 2025): Removed French language support from the multilingual system per user request. The app now supports 6 languages: English, Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Spanish, and Indonesian. Updated TypeScript language types and removed all French translations from the internationalization system.
- **Chat and Invite Popup Positioning** (July 19, 2025): Moved chat popup and game invitation popup from bottom-right corner to center of screen for better user experience. Updated positioning from fixed bottom-right to centered overlay with proper responsive design.
- **Browser Disconnect Abandonment Removed** (July 19, 2025): Removed browser disconnect game abandonment logic per user preference. Games now only abandon when users explicitly click Leave Room or Main Menu buttons, NOT when browser is closed or connection lost. Players can now close browser and return to continue their games without triggering abandonment.
- **Game Start Synchronization Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed critical "Game is already running in this room" error that occurred when both players tried to start games simultaneously. Updated logic to return existing active game instead of blocking, ensuring both players can successfully join games without synchronization conflicts during brief timing windows.
- **Game Abandonment on Disconnect Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed critical gap in game abandonment logic where games weren't abandoned when players exited without making moves. Root cause was WebSocket 'close' event handler only triggering room cleanup for non-active games, while active games were left hanging when players disconnected unexpectedly (browser close, network issues, etc.). Added comprehensive game abandonment logic to WebSocket disconnect handling that mirrors the explicit leave_room behavior - marks game as 'abandoned' in database, broadcasts game_abandoned message to all remaining players/spectators with unique user deduplication, redirects all users to homepage, and cleans up all room states. Now works consistently whether players explicitly leave rooms or disconnect unexpectedly, ensuring no games are left in limbo.
- **Username Database Sync Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed critical issue where usernames were appearing as NULL in the database even though they existed in the JSON user storage. Root cause was the main `syncAllUsersToDatabase()` function missing the username field in the upsert operation, while other sync operations correctly included it. Updated all user sync operations (registration, login, profile updates, email verification, password reset, and startup sync) to consistently include the username field when upserting user data to the database. All existing users with NULL usernames are now properly synced with their correct usernames from the JSON storage during application startup. The head-to-head stats feature was also fixed by correcting the API endpoint structure and data interface to properly display comparative game statistics between friends.
- **Online Mode Session Persistence Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed issue where users were automatically switched back to AI mode after playing 4-5 online games. Root cause was state reset logic forcing selectedMode back to 'ai' during game expiration, game abandonment, and main menu resets. Updated state management to preserve user's selected game mode preference, only initializing local AI games when explicitly in AI mode. Users can now stay in online mode for consecutive games without being forced back to local AI mode.
- **Intermittent Game Start Race Condition Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed subtle WebSocket race condition causing 1 out of 6-7 games to not start properly for both players. Root cause was API responses arriving before WebSocket broadcasts, causing game board sync issues. Implemented proper synchronization with Promise-based WebSocket delivery tracking and delayed API responses (50ms) to ensure WebSocket messages are processed first. Added error handling for failed WebSocket sends and logging for broadcast completion. Both players now consistently receive game state updates and see the game board immediately upon game start.
- **Display Name Database Sync Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed database synchronization issue where display name updates weren't properly synced between JSON storage and database. Updated `updateUser` function to correctly map displayName field to database, fixed registration sync to use proper field mapping, and enhanced startup user sync to ensure all existing display names are properly stored in database. Users' chosen display names now persist correctly across all systems.
- **Winner Display Name Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed game over modal to properly display winner's display name instead of showing "Player [username] Wins!". Updated translation strings to remove "Player" prefix from all languages, now showing just "[DisplayName] Wins!". The system now correctly prioritizes display name over username/firstName, so users see their chosen display name (e.g., "Awii Wins!" instead of "Player awaismushtaq Wins!").
- **Spectator Play Again Button Restriction** (July 19, 2025): Prevented spectators from seeing the play again button in the game over modal. Added logic to check the current user's role in room participants and pass an `isSpectator` prop to the GameOverModal component. The play again button is now only visible to actual players, ensuring spectators cannot initiate new games.
- **Complete Verification Code System with Database Sync** (July 19, 2025): Replaced both email verification and forgot password links with 6-digit verification codes for better user experience. Users now receive numeric codes (e.g., 123456) via email instead of clickable links for both email verification and password reset. Updated email templates with prominent code display, modified verification and reset password pages to accept code input with validation, enhanced modals with code-specific messaging and direct navigation to respective pages. Backend generates secure 6-digit codes for both verification and password reset flows, maintaining 1-hour expiry for password reset codes and 24-hour expiry for verification codes. Added complete database synchronization for all verification and password reset operations to ensure JSON and database consistency.
- **Case-Insensitive Email Authentication Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed email case-sensitivity issue in authentication system allowing users to login with their email regardless of capitalization (Sam00828@gmail.com vs sam00828@gmail.com). Updated `findUserByEmail` function to perform case-insensitive comparisons and modified `createUser` function to store all emails in lowercase for consistency. Users can now login with any combination of uppercase/lowercase letters in their email addresses.
- **Game Abandonment JavaScript Error Fix** (July 19, 2025): Completely resolved the "Something went wrong" error that occurred when players left active games. Implemented direct WebSocket message handling that shows a red notification toast and performs clean page reload after 2 seconds, bypassing problematic React state management that was causing application crashes. Game abandonment now works smoothly without screen blinking or JavaScript errors.
- **Enhanced Screen Blinking Fix After Room Exit** (July 19, 2025): Improved the previous screen blinking fix by implementing longer timeout delays (200-250ms) and better state batching in all room exit scenarios. Single batched state updates now prevent multiple rapid re-renders when leaving rooms, switching to AI mode after online games, and handling game abandonment/expiration. Enhanced game state cleanup with proper initialization sequencing to ensure smooth transitions without visual flickering.
- **Game Mode Transition Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed "Game Ended" error when selecting AI mode after leaving online rooms by implementing proper state cleanup and automatic local game initialization. Enhanced game mode switching to clear online game remnants and seamlessly transition to local modes with proper state batching and error prevention.
- **WebSocket Connection Management** (July 19, 2025): Simplified WebSocket connection handling by removing complex global singleton pattern and reverting to reliable single-instance management. Fixed connection state synchronization and improved online/offline status display accuracy.
- **Online Game Exit Handling System** (July 19, 2025): Implemented comprehensive room exit handling that automatically terminates games and redirects all users when a player leaves during active gameplay. When a player exits an online multiplayer room during an active game, the system marks the game as 'abandoned' in the database, sends all remaining players and spectators back to the home page, clears all room connections, and displays clear notifications about the game termination. Added finishGame method to storage interface for proper game state management. This ensures no players are left waiting in abandoned games and maintains clean database state.

- **Game Abandonment Blinking Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed screen blinking issue that occurred when players left rooms during active games. The problem was caused by: 1) Multiple duplicate WebSocket connections for the same user receiving multiple `game_abandoned` messages, and 2) Client-side state reset delays (350ms + 200ms) causing visual flickering. Solution implemented: Server-side deduplication ensures each user gets only one abandonment message by tracking unique user IDs, and client-side immediate state synchronization (50ms delay) prevents multiple render cycles that caused blinking. This creates a smooth, immediate transition back to the main menu without visual artifacts.
- **Fake Win Data Database Fix** (July 19, 2025): Successfully eliminated all fake/synthetic win data from the database to ensure only authentic gameplay statistics are displayed. Fixed AI bot system that was generating deterministic fake statistics (5-50 wins, 5-30 losses, 2-10 draws) based on bot index calculations. Updated bot creation to start with zero stats and only increment through real game results. Reset all existing bot fake statistics and recalculated based on actual games played. Now only 17 bots who have participated in real games show statistics, while remaining 83 bots correctly display zero wins/losses. Leaderboard now displays 100% authentic data from genuine gameplay sessions.
- **Bottom Left Leaderboard Button Removal** (July 19, 2025): Successfully removed the floating green leaderboard button from bottom left of screen while maintaining header leaderboard functionality. Fixed header leaderboard button to work with state management instead of custom events. Updated Leaderboard component to accept external open/onClose props for better control. Header leaderboard button with trophy icon now properly opens the leaderboard modal when clicked.
- **10-Minute Game Expiration System** (July 19, 2025): Implemented automatic game expiration system that expires games after 10 minutes of inactivity to prevent abandoned sessions. Features include: automatic background checks every 2 minutes for expired games, immediate game expiration when users reconnect to games older than 10 minutes, proper database tracking with lastMoveAt timestamps updated on every move, automatic return to lobby for all players when games expire, clear notifications about game expiration, and cleanup of room connections and user states. System ensures users only reconnect to active games and automatically returns them to homepage if their game has expired or ended.
- **Offline Reconnection System** (July 19, 2025): Implemented comprehensive offline reconnection system for seamless game recovery. When users lose connection during gameplay (phone calls, network issues, etc.), they can return and automatically reconnect to their active game with full state recovery. Features include: persistent game state storage with lastMoveAt timestamps, automatic reconnection detection on WebSocket auth, complete game state recovery with player info and achievements, visual reconnection notifications for both reconnecting and remaining players, and improved user experience for temporary disconnections. Players are now kept in active games when disconnected and can resume gameplay exactly where they left off.
- **Matchmaking System Synchronization Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed critical matchmaking system where real user matches and bot matchmaking (25-second timeout) could interfere with each other. Real player matches now properly notify both players simultaneously via WebSocket before API responses, ensuring synchronized game start. Bot matchmaking includes better queue validation to prevent conflicts when users are matched with real players. Both players now receive proper match notifications and game state updates regardless of who joined the queue first.
- **API Polling Optimization** (July 19, 2025): Optimized room invitations API polling to reduce unnecessary network requests. Changed polling interval from 3 seconds to 10 seconds and added 8-second stale time to prevent redundant calls when data hasn't changed. This significantly reduces API calls from every 3-4 seconds to every 10 seconds, improving performance and reducing server load.
- **Bot Avatar Profile Picture Fix** (July 19, 2025): Fixed critical bug where bot profile pictures (now beautiful animal/nature images) were disappearing when bots made moves during gameplay and during reconnection. Root cause was bot profile information not being properly transmitted in move broadcasts and reconnection logic. Fixed by ensuring bot's profile picture and profile image URL are correctly included in WebSocket move messages, reconnection data, and game over broadcasts, maintaining consistent player information display throughout the game lifecycle.
- **Real Animal/Nature Bot Avatars** (July 19, 2025): Replaced colored placeholder bot avatars with 50+ real animal, nature, and bird images from Unsplash. Bot profile pictures now feature foxes, elephants, pandas, parrots, eagles, owls, sea creatures, forest animals, mountain animals, tropical animals, and arctic animals. All images are properly sized (80x80) and cropped for optimal profile picture display.
- **Simplified Arabic Leaderboard Layout** (July 19, 2025): Completely redesigned leaderboard layout for better Arabic language support with simplified card structure. Changes include: removed complex grid layouts that caused spacing issues, implemented clean 3-column stats grid (Wins, Win Rate, Games) with proper centering, added RTL modal direction support with native Arabic fonts, simplified W-L-D display as centered badge, reduced problematic flex-row-reverse usage, optimized mobile spacing with smaller padding for Arabic users, and maintained LTR direction for all numerical data. The new layout provides cleaner Arabic experience without layout conflicts or empty spaces on mobile devices.
- **Leaderboard System with Mobile Responsive Layout** (July 19, 2025): Implemented comprehensive leaderboard system showing top 100 players ranked by wins. Features include advanced backend API with sorting by wins/win rate/total games, beautiful frontend component with achievement borders and animations, mobile-responsive layout with proper text truncation and overflow handling, custom event system for modal triggers, and full internationalization support in all 6 languages. Fixed layout issues including username badge overflow and game count text going outside borders. Leaderboard accessible through golden trophy button in header sidebar and displays player profiles, win rates, and complete statistics with spectacular achievement border effects.
- **Spectacular Visual Effects for New Achievements** (July 18, 2025): Added extraordinary visual border effects for the new high-level achievements. "Grandmaster" achievement (200 wins) features an elegant diamond border with soft indigo, silver, purple, and gold colors cycling through sophisticated animations with subtle scaling and rotation. "Ultimate Veteran" achievement (500 games) displays the most spectacular inferno border effect with intense fire colors (tomato, deep pink, orange red), dramatic scaling, rotation, brightness/saturation filters, gradient shifting background, and a shimmering overlay animation. These visual effects surpass even the Champion achievement, making Ultimate Veteran the most visually impressive status in the game. Both new effects are applied to player names on the game board for both Player X and Player O, ensuring all players can see these prestigious visual distinctions.
- **New High-Level Achievements Added** (July 18, 2025): Added two new prestigious achievements for dedicated players - "Grandmaster" achievement for reaching 200 total wins (💎 diamond icon) and "Ultimate Veteran" achievement for playing 500 total games (🔥 fire icon). Updated achievement system in both backend validation and frontend display to include these new milestones. Enhanced AchievementModal and AchievementBadge components with translations in all 6 supported languages. Updated achievement categorization - Grandmaster in Victory Achievements and Ultimate Veteran in Experience Achievements. These achievements provide long-term goals for the most dedicated players and extend the progression system beyond the previous 100-win Champion achievement.
- **Mobile UI Responsiveness Improvements** (July 18, 2025): Fixed mobile layout issues across the application including room management buttons, game statistics section, and sidebar components. Updated Room Management to stack "Join as Player" and "Join as Spectator" buttons vertically on mobile devices instead of horizontally. Optimized game statistics grid to use responsive columns (2 on mobile, 4 on larger screens). Improved mobile text sizing, padding, and spacing throughout the interface. Enhanced sidebar spacing and profile section for better mobile experience. Mobile users now have proper layout without content overflow.
- **Profile Picture Upload Limit Increased to 1MB** (July 18, 2025): Increased profile picture upload limit from ~50KB to 1MB by updating Express middleware configuration (express.json and express.urlencoded) to accept larger payloads. Updated both ProfilePictureUpload and ProfileManager components to validate 1MB file size instead of 5MB. Added new translation key "selectImageUnder1MB" in all 6 supported languages. Users can now upload higher quality profile pictures without size restriction errors.
- **Room Invitation Duplicate Key Error Fix** (July 18, 2025): Fixed duplicate key constraint violation error that occurred when reinviting friends after 30 seconds. Root cause was expired invitations remaining in database with unique constraint on (room_id, invited_id). Updated sendRoomInvitation() to delete any existing invitations for the same room and user before creating new ones, eliminating duplicate key errors. Users can now seamlessly reinvite friends without database conflicts.
- **30-Second Room Invitation Expiration System** (July 18, 2025): Implemented automatic 30-second expiration for room invitations to prevent "invitation already sent" errors. Room invitations now expire after 30 seconds if no response is received, allowing users to send new invitations. System automatically cleans up expired invitations before checking for duplicates. Updated sendRoomInvitation() to set 30-second expiration instead of 24 hours. Added automatic cleanup calls in all invitation-related methods (sendRoomInvitation, getRoomInvitations, respondToRoomInvitation). Expired invitations are marked as 'expired' status and users can immediately send new invitations without waiting.
- **Achievement Synchronization Fix** (July 18, 2025): Fixed critical bug where achievements were incorrectly granted based on >= conditions instead of exact milestone achievements. Users were receiving "Champion" achievement (100 wins) when they only had 51 wins. Root cause was achievement logic using >= comparisons for milestone achievements, granting all lower achievements simultaneously. Fixed by updating checkAndGrantAchievements() to use exact milestone conditions (e.g., wins === 50 for Legend, wins === 100 for Champion). Added automatic achievement validation system that runs when achievements are viewed. Removed manual "Fix Achievements" button since achievements now auto-sync. Achievement system now properly grants achievements only when exact milestones are reached.
- **Friend Request Synchronization Fix** (July 18, 2025): Fixed critical bug where unfriending a user didn't properly sync with the database, causing "already friends" error when trying to send new friend requests. Root cause was that removeFriend() only deleted from friendships table but left orphaned "accepted" friend requests in the database. Fixed by updating removeFriend() to clean up both friendship records and corresponding accepted friend requests. Enhanced sendFriendRequest() to handle orphaned data and added cleanup endpoint for existing data issues. Friend system now properly synchronizes unfriend/friend operations with the database.
- **Universal Multi-Language Support** (July 18, 2025): Implemented comprehensive internationalization system supporting 5 languages - English (en), Arabic (ar), Bengali (bn), Hindi (hi), Spanish (es), and Indonesian (id). Features include: complete translation system with 80+ UI elements covering game rules, quick chat messages, game modes, difficulty levels, settings, and all interface elements. Full RTL (Right-to-Left) support for Arabic with proper text direction and layout mirroring, language-specific font families for optimal readability, persistent language preference stored in localStorage, and automatic page refresh for RTL/LTR layout changes. All components (landing page, auth forms, game modes, game rules, quick chat, headers, buttons, etc.) now display in user's chosen language. Translation system is fully type-safe with TypeScript support and uses database URL from server/db.ts for all operations. Fixed all duplicate key errors and database sync issues.
- **Champion Achievement with Cosmic Border** (July 18, 2025): Added ultimate "Champion" achievement for players who reach 100 total wins. Champion players get an incredible cosmic border effect that cycles through purple, blue, gold, and pink colors with advanced animations including scaling, rotation, and text shadows. The border features a gradient background and multiple animation layers for a truly spectacular cosmic effect. This surpasses the Legend achievement as the most prestigious status in the game.
- **Legend Achievement with Animated Fire Border** (July 18, 2025): Added new "Legend" achievement for players who reach 50 total wins. Players with this achievement get a spectacular animated fire border around their name on the game board - cycling through orange, red, and yellow flame effects with pulsing animations. The border creates a realistic fire effect with colors ranging from deep orange (#ff4500) to bright yellow (#ffcc00), making Legend players stand out as true champions. Player names become bold and the animation speed is faster (1.5s) for dynamic fire effect. Achievement is now visible in the frontend achievement modal so users know they need 50 wins to earn this prestigious status.
- **Chat Functionality Moved from Online Users to Friends** (July 18, 2025): Removed chat functionality from Online Users modal and moved it to Friends component. Users can now only chat with their friends, not with any online player. Online Users modal now focuses on viewing profiles and blocking/unblocking users. Friends component includes chat buttons with unread message indicators and full chat interface with message history, real-time messaging, and proper WebSocket integration. This change improves user privacy and focuses communication on established relationships.
- **Play Again for Both Players & Game Synchronization Fix** (July 18, 2025): Fixed play again functionality so both players can start new games, not just room owner. Updated backend to allow any player in room to start games and frontend to show Start Game button for both players. Fixed critical play again synchronization issue where first player could see moves but second player couldn't - removed local game state setting in handlePlayAgain to let server broadcast ensure both players get identical game state. Enhanced room participant fetching in RoomManager to properly check player roles.
- **Game Status Management & Duplicate Start Prevention** (July 18, 2025): Implemented comprehensive game status management system that prevents duplicate game starts. When "Start Game" button is clicked or Quick Match succeeds, room status changes to "playing" and start button becomes disabled showing "Game Running". Backend validates room status and rejects start requests if game already running. Fixed RoomManager to use correct /api/rooms/:roomId/start-game endpoint instead of generic /api/games. Room status resets to "waiting" when games end allowing new games to start. Both manual room creation and matchmaking now properly manage room status throughout game lifecycle.
- **Invitation System Optimization & API Polling Fix** (July 18, 2025): Fixed invitation popup error by correcting frontend/backend response value mismatch ('accept'/'decline' vs 'accepted'/'rejected'). Removed Reset Game button from online multiplayer games to prevent confusion. Fixed unnecessary API polling when users are not authenticated by adding authentication checks to InvitationPopup, RoomInvitationNotifications, and PlayerList components. Removed RoomInvitationNotifications component completely, keeping only InvitationPopup for cleaner architecture and reduced API calls.
- **Room Invitation System & Game State Synchronization Fix** (July 18, 2025): Successfully implemented complete friend invitation system for private rooms. Fixed critical database type casting issues (UUID vs VARCHAR mismatches) in room invitation queries using proper SQL type casting. Enhanced WebSocket room joining logic to automatically send current game state to newly joined players, ensuring invited friends can see active games immediately. Room owners can invite friends who receive real-time notifications with accept/decline options. When friends accept invitations, they're automatically added as room participants and receive complete game board state if a game is in progress.
- **Sparkle Explosion Celebration Effect** (July 18, 2025): Successfully implemented spectacular visual celebration system with 60 colorful sparkles that burst outward from screen center when someone wins. Each sparkle has random size, color, position, and animation timing creating natural firework-like explosion effect. Sparkles start small, grow larger, then fade out as they travel outward in all directions. Added glowing box-shadow effects and CSS animations for smooth visual experience. Celebration only triggers for wins, not draws. Attempted multiple audio implementations but removed due to browser compatibility issues causing page crashes - kept stable visual-only celebration that works perfectly.
- **Achievement Modal Mobile Fix** (July 17, 2025): Fixed achievement tab overlapping with mobile navigation by redesigning modal layout for mobile screens. Changed modal height from 80vh to 85vh, implemented proper flexbox layout with flex-shrink-0 headers and footers, added proper scrolling for content area, and included visual separator for close button. Redesigned achievement badges from horizontal grid to vertical list layout - each badge now displays horizontally with icon on left and name/description on right, providing better mobile readability and preventing overlap issues.
- **Chat Message Duplication Fix** (July 17, 2025): Fixed critical bug where chat messages appeared twice in chatbox due to duplicate WebSocket event dispatching. Root cause was both useWebSocket.ts and home.tsx dispatching the same 'chat_message_received' event. Fixed by removing duplicate dispatch from home.tsx and simplifying ChatPopup to only handle initial messages through props, ensuring each message appears exactly once in both popup and chatbox.
- **Achievement Badge UI Fix** (July 17, 2025): Fixed UI layout issue where achievement badges were overlapping Profile and Chat buttons in Online Players modal. Reorganized layout to separate achievement badges into their own row below user information, ensuring buttons remain fully accessible while maintaining clean visual hierarchy.
- **Matchmaking Synchronization Fix** (July 17, 2025): Fixed critical matchmaking bug where one player would start a room while the other remained in matchmaking queue. Root cause was duplicate WebSocket message handling and multiple room join attempts. Fixed by adding duplicate detection for match_found/matchmaking_response messages, preventing duplicate room joins through state tracking, and clearing room state on WebSocket reconnect to ensure clean matchmaking flow.
- **Theme API & Emoji Broadcasting Fixes** (July 17, 2025): Fixed special theme fetching errors by adding robust error handling for theme API calls, ensuring themes load properly even when database queries fail. Enhanced emoji reaction WebSocket broadcasting with better logging and validation, fixing issue where second emoji reactions weren't visible to other players in online games.
- **Matchmaking Auto-Start Fix** (July 16, 2025): Fixed matchmaking synchronization issue where matched players were placed in rooms but games weren't automatically started. Added auto-game creation logic that triggers 2 seconds after successful matchmaking, ensuring both players get a seamless experience from matchmaking queue to active gameplay. Eliminated duplicate WebSocket message handlers that were causing client-side warnings.
- **Achievement Badge UI Improvements** (July 16, 2025): Removed yellow circle background from achievement badges in game board for cleaner appearance, changed to simple text styling with proper theme support. Game board now shows only the latest achievement badge earned by each player instead of first victory badge. Enhanced WebSocket synchronization with better state management and forced re-renders to fix React sync issues between players. Removed date logic from achievement tooltips and displays throughout the application.
- **Complete Achievement System with Seasonal Themes** (July 16, 2025): Implemented comprehensive achievement system with 7 different badges (First Win, Win Streak Master, Master of Diagonals, Speed Demon, Veteran Player, Comeback King, True Champion) that unlock automatically when players reach specific milestones. Added seasonal themes (Halloween, Christmas, Summer) that unlock through achievements - Win Streak Master unlocks Halloween theme, Speed Demon unlocks Christmas theme, and Veteran Player unlocks Summer theme. Created database schema with achievements and user_themes tables, built beautiful achievement modal with locked/unlocked states, enhanced theme selector to show locked themes, and integrated achievement button into header sidebar. Fixed matchmaking synchronization issue where players received different message types causing inconsistent room joining behavior.
- **JSON to Neon Database Sync** (July 15, 2025): Added comprehensive user synchronization between JSON file storage and Neon database. System now automatically syncs all existing JSON users to the database on server startup, ensuring complete data consistency. Added manual sync endpoint for admin users to trigger sync on demand. All user operations (registration, login, profile updates) now maintain dual storage for compatibility
- **Email Service Migration to SMTP** (July 15, 2025): Removed SendGrid dependency and migrated to pure nodemailer SMTP configuration for email verification and password reset functionality. System now uses SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, and FROM_EMAIL environment variables for email service configuration. Added enhanced logging for email service initialization and sending status to help with debugging
- **Play Again Feature Fix** (July 15, 2025): Fixed critical bug where "Play Again" button wasn't working in online multiplayer mode - root cause was old finished game objects being reused instead of creating fresh game states. Fixed by clearing current game state before creating new game, ensuring fresh game objects with active status, empty board, and proper player assignments. Enhanced WebSocket game_started handling to force complete state reset and prevent stale game data
- **Quick Chat System Replacement** (July 17, 2025): Replaced emoji reaction system with comprehensive quick chat functionality. Players can now use 12 predefined quick messages like "Good luck!", "Well played!", "Nice move!", "Play faster!", etc. through a "Chat" button. Messages appear as small text bubbles next to player profiles with smooth animations and auto-fade after 3-4 seconds. Chat messages are properly synchronized between players in online games via WebSocket broadcasting. Updated both client and server-side handling from player_reaction to player_chat message types. Removed EmojiReactionPanel component and replaced with QuickChatPanel for better communication experience
- **Dynamic Player Ranking Visualization** (July 15, 2025): Implemented comprehensive ranking visualization system with three interactive view modes - List view with animated ranking changes and streak indicators, Chart view with win rate distribution and games played visualizations, and Stats view with overview metrics including total players, average win rate, most active player, and top streaks. Added real-time rank change tracking, animated transitions, and enhanced visual feedback for player performance
- **Critical Move Disappearing Bug Fix** (July 15, 2025): Fixed major bug where moves disappeared after 1 second in all game modes - root cause was GameBoard component being remounted due to timestamp-based key prop, causing React to lose all internal state. Fixed by removing timestamp from component key and optimizing board state persistence for both local and online games
- **Online Game Synchronization Fix** (July 15, 2025): Enhanced WebSocket board synchronization for online multiplayer games by adding proper useEffect dependencies for board state, currentPlayer, and timestamp changes, ensuring real-time move updates appear immediately for both players
- **Database Migration to Personal Neon Account** (July 15, 2025): Successfully migrated from Replit-managed Neon database to user's own Neon account for full database ownership and portability - migrated 3 users, 10 rooms, 10 games, 17 participants, and 50 moves with zero data loss, ensuring complete database control and deployment flexibility
- **Header Menu System** (July 15, 2025): Replaced logout button with hamburger menu dropdown in header containing theme selector, online players, profile settings, and logout - improved mobile experience with organized dropdown menu accessible from header while maintaining clean navigation
- **Header Mobile Optimization** (July 15, 2025): Moved theme selector and online players button from crowded header to organized Settings card in sidebar - improved mobile responsiveness and cleaner navigation with dedicated settings section containing theme customization and player count display
- **Block User Feature** (July 15, 2025): Added comprehensive user blocking system in chat - users can block/unblock other players, blocked users are visually indicated with red badges, messages from blocked users are automatically filtered out, chat input is disabled for blocked users, and blocked users have limited chat functionality while still appearing in online users list with unblock option
- **Autumn Theme Addition** (July 15, 2025): Replaced Aurora theme with smooth Autumn theme featuring warm orange and amber colors, subtle gradients, and gentle transitions - designed to be easy on the eyes with no distracting animations or bright effects
- **Custom Theme System** (July 15, 2025): Added comprehensive theme system with 6 visual styles (Default, Neon, Autumn, Minimalist, Nature, Space) - players can customize game board appearance, colors, and styling through theme selector in header. Themes persist in localStorage and dynamically update all game components including cells, player indicators, and UI elements
- **Chat System Removed from Game Board** (July 15, 2025): Removed in-game chat functionality from the game board component to keep the gaming experience focused and clean. Chat functionality remains available in the main lobby through the Online Players modal
- **Unread Message Indicator** (July 15, 2025): Added red circular badge on Chat buttons showing number of unread messages, with automatic clearing when starting a conversation and proper cleanup when users go offline
